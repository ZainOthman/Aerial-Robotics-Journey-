- ROS2 (Robot Operating System)
- Gazebo simulation environment
- Python & C++ for robotics
- MAVROS for MAVLink communication

**Fundamentals:**
- Linear algebra and matrix operations
- Calculus and differential equations
- Control theory (PID, state-space)
- Probability and estimation theory

**Hardware & Systems:**
- Drone dynamics and aerodynamics
- Sensor fusion (GPS, IMU, cameras)
- Communication protocols (MAVLink)

## 🚀 Projects

### Project 1: Basic PX4 Flight Control
**Status:** 🔄 In Progress  
**Timeline:** February 2026

**Objective:** Master basic flight control in simulation before moving to autonomous navigation

**What I've accomplished:**
- ✅ Successfully installed PX4, Gazebo, and ROS2 on macOS (Apple Silicon)
- ✅ Launched SITL (Software-In-The-Loop) simulation environment
- ✅ Commanded basic takeoff and landing using `commander` commands
- ✅ Understanding the PX4 architecture and flight modes

**Current challenge:**
- ⚠️ Debugging camera plugin integration in Gazebo
- 🔧 Learning proper sensor integration and Gazebo SDF format
- 📖 Understanding ROS2-Gazebo-PX4 communication pipeline

**Lessons learned so far:**
- Breaking things is a normal part of learning robotics
- Documentation and version control are essential
- Always test in simulation before touching hardware
- The robotics stack is complex but learnable piece by piece

**Next steps:**
1. Fix camera plugin integration
2. Successfully stream camera feed to ROS2
3. Implement basic computer vision (lane detection or object detection)
4. Use camera data for decision making

**Resources I'm using:**
- [PX4 User Guide](https://docs.px4.io/)
- [PX4 Developer Guide](https://dev.px4.io/)
- [ROS2 Documentation](https://docs.ros.org/)
- [Gazebo Tutorials](https://gazebosim.org/docs)
